body:

I am a pediatric nephrologist working in northwest China.  If you know medicine at all you know that nephrologists tend toward the nerdy end of the social spectrum (have you ever seen our toys?) and I am no different.  I enjoy learning about new things (except diesel engines, just can't seem to care about diesel engines) and this blog exists to document lessons learned. I do hope it is helpful to you.
